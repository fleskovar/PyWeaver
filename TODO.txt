Comming up next:

    Node display window:
        Avoid mutating a prop directly
        Property or method "display_code" Error on console

    Cell contextmenu:
        recalc

    Framework:
        Undo, redo
        Drag cell into edge => make quick connections
    
    Changing code once inputs are generated:
        Adding new inputs to node break everything
        Changing output variable names break server side connections

    Sync bug:
        New server instance overwrites server model

    Node display window:        
        Sync scope
        Retrieve results
        Integrate NodeDisplay component into NodeViewer
        Big display block
        Mini display block
        Full plotly integration
        Add a nice grid component to the big display

    Node Library:
        Interactive filter (plotly moving points example)
        Upsample/Downsample
        Regression returs functions
        GP
        Windowing
        Grouping / Time based segmentation (make segments based on the first variable that changes in a set)
        Rule association
        Kalman filter
        Rolling std/mu
        Feature engineering

    Table Input:
        Multi td selection
        Clear all button
        Copy from table
        Shift+arrows
        Delete key clears cell
        Context menu

    Node display:
        Fire auto-recalc on display input change

    UI Improvements:
        Grouping    

    Nodes not being properly deleted on serve:
        Setting overlay of already deleted node

    Error display:
        Not working properly

    Library bug:
        Prevent folders names with spaces.

Backlog:

    Code editor:
        On open, it should default to code tab. Currently the code tab does not get the underlay.

    Hide inputs:
        Specify on node meta (maybe add as a comment somewhere in the code?)

    Table/Vector/Time Series:
        Visualize Output

    Server/client startup:
        Initial delay when loading from library
        Add 'thinking' icon
        Delay in model sync with server

    Fix dark mode refresh pf Cells    

    Nodes:
        Coloring/Visual queue optional input
        Connector type & validation
        Cell selection disabled on display
        No cell dragging with secondary button

    Node Library:        
        Package management with zips
        Manage library installs
        Images for calcs

    UI Improvements:        
        Layers (show)
        Grouping
        Node Search/Find on flowsheet => Focus
        Tooltips
        Tabs?
        New window plot/table/ui display (multi monitor)

    Testing

    Code reload:
        Cells dont get properly updated until zoom in/out

    Develop new nodes:        
        Date/time picker

    Python:
        Compile workflow into single python file
        Pass node/string of nodes as a function
        Celery/Paralelization
        Graph not computing for all independent branches (check execution order algorithm)

    Replace mxgraph:
        Find something that integrates more nicely with Vue/Vuetify?

    Code editors:        
        Code editor 'dirtyness'

    Store:
        <<Haven't been able to replicate>>
        Some nodes keep their results even when connections are replaced
        (probable connections are note being deleted properly)
