Migrating to Vue3 and latest vuetify?

Comming up next:

    Refactor:
        - Create a refactor menu on the right inspector
        - Refactor: right click node UI -> "to input"
        - Refactor: right click input -> "to UI"
        -Zip arguments
        -Zip output
        
    Node display window:
        Fire auto-recalc on display input change ($forceUpdate()?)
        Refactor NodeDisplay & Big/Small display component (they share too much similar code)
        Only update dirty nodes
        Force window reupdate if UI code is changed        
        Property or method "display_code" Error on console    

    Recalc keyboard shortcut (Shift+Enter)

    Display in new window: input UI does not get propagated

    Node display:
        
    Loading:
        Make canvas load edges positions
        Make code editor tabs
            Sortable tabs/chips
            Load tabs into canvas

    Variables visualization:
        right click output -> print
        Add vector output

    Node library menu horizontal scrolling

    Input bug on server:
        Build simple plot of y = x**2 but return x (linear function), then change the return from x to y.

    Copy&Paste:
        Support multi node copy&paste, with connections    

    Framework:
        Undo, redo
        Drag cell into edge => make quick connections
    
    Changing code once inputs are generated:
        Adding new inputs to node break everything
        Changing output variable names break server side connections

    Sync bug:
        New server instance overwrites server model

    Node display window:        
        Sync scope
        Retrieve results
        Integrate NodeDisplay component into NodeViewer
        Full plotly integration
        Add a nice grid component to the big display

    Node Library:
        Interactive filter (plotly moving points example)
        Upsample/Downsample
        Regression returs functions
        GP
        Kernel Windowing
        Grouping / Time based segmentation (make segments based on the first variable that changes in a set)
        Rule association
        Kalman filter
        Rolling (windowed) std/mu
        Feature engineering
        Quickly plot approximated Normal distribution

    Table Input:
        Multi td selection
        Clear all button
        Copy from table
        Shift+arrows
        Delete key clears cell
        Context menu    

    UI Improvements:
        Grouping    

    Nodes not being properly deleted on server:
        Setting overlay of already deleted node

    Error display:
        Not working properly

    Library bug:
        Prevent folders names with spaces.

Backlog:

    Find a better way to store results/inputs of flowsheet:
        Maybe just store UI inputs? Optional store results?
        code should be stored as reference to library when possible

    Code editor:
        On open, it should default to code tab. Currently the code tab does not get the underlay.

    Hide inputs:
        Specify on node meta (maybe add as a comment somewhere in the code?)

    Table/Vector/Time Series:
        Visualize Output

    Server/client startup:
        Initial delay when loading from library
        Add 'thinking' icon
        Delay in model sync with server

    Fix dark mode refresh pf Cells    

    Nodes:
        Coloring/Visual queue optional input
        Connector type & validation
        Cell selection disabled on display
        No cell dragging with secondary button

    Node Library:        
        Package management with zips
        Manage library installs
        Images for calcs

    UI Improvements:        
        Layers (show)
        Grouping
        Node Search/Find on flowsheet => Focus
        Tooltips
        Tabs?
        New window plot/table/ui display (multi monitor)

    Testing

    Code reload:
        Cells dont get properly updated until zoom in/out

    Develop new nodes:        
        Date/time picker

    Python:
        Compile workflow into single python file
        Pass node/string of nodes as a function
        Celery/Paralelization
        Graph not computing for all independent branches (check execution order algorithm)

    Replace mxgraph:
        Find something that integrates more nicely with Vue/Vuetify?

    Code editors:        
        Code editor 'dirtyness'

    Store:
        <<Haven't been able to replicate>>
        Some nodes keep their results even when connections are replaced
        (probable connections are note being deleted properly)
