        Rule association
        Kalman filter
        Rolling std/mu
        Feature engineering

    Table Input:

        Clear all button
        Copy from table
        Shift+arrows
        Delete key clears cell
        Context menu

    Node display:
        Fire auto-recalc on display input change

    UI Improvements:
        Grouping    

    Nodes not being properly deleted on serve:
        Setting overlay of already deleted node

    Node code editing:
        changing the name of 1 output var throws an error

    Error display:
        Not working properly

Backlog:

    Hide inputs:
        Specify on meta

    Window node:
        Show window plot

    Table/Vector/Time Series:
        Visualize Output

    Server/client startup:
        Initial delay when loading from library
        Add 'thinking' icon
        Delay in model sync with server

    Fix dark mode refresh pf Cells    

    Nodes:
        Coloring optional input
        Connector type & validation
        Cell selection disabled on display
        No cell dragging with secondary button

    Node Library:        
        Package management with zips
        Manage library installs
        Images for calcs

    UI Improvements:        
        Layers (show)
        Grouping
        Node Search/Find on flowsheet => Focus
        Tooltips
        Tabs?
        New window plot/table/ui display (multi monitor)

    Testing

    Code reload:
        Cells dont get properly updated until zoom in/out

    Develop new nodes:        
        Date/time picker

    UI Improvements:

        Plotly: 
            Cells mouse events 

    Python:
        Compile workflow into single python file
        Pass node/string of nodes as a function
        Celery/Paralelization
        Graph not computing for all independent branches (check execution order algorithm)

    Replace mxgraph:
        Find something that integrates more nicely with Vue/Vuetify?

    Code editors:        
        Code editor 'dirtyness'
